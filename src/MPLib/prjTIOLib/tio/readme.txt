You can compile your own source code in TSMaster mini program to extend TSMaster abilities.
With this SDK you can even build a TSMaster again.
Steps for migration:
[1] open project file and compile using x86 configuration, you get the dll file
[2] drag this dll into TSMaster, so this mini program is installed as a library
[3] just run this library in mini program library manager, or call its functions in other mini programs
[4] if you want to debug this dll, please set output dir to: D:\Projects\TigerTe\Projects\2023-12_TigerTE_Hardware\src\MPLib\config\bin\
